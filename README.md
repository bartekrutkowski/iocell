iocell
======

**A FreeBSD jail manager.**

iocell is a zero dependency, drop in jail/container manager amalgamating some
of the best features and technologies the FreeBSD operating system has to offer.
It is geared for ease of use with a simple and easy to understand command syntax.

It has been forked from iocage, when iocage has been abandoned, but not released
by its author. This fork's goal is purely to support 'classic iocage' experience
and add fixes and features requested by iocage users.

iocell is in the FreeBSD ports tree as sysutils/iocell.
To install using binary packages, simply run: `pkg install iocell`

## WARNING:
The `develop` branch may not be functional at any given point. This is where a lot of experimental work gets done. No guarantees for stability or migrations within the branch are given. Things can and do change rapidly. **_Please don't use it if you require stability._**

- **Contributing**: If you would like to submit a pull request, we kindly ask you to open it against the `develop` branch.

####Raising an issue:

We _like_ issues! If you are having trouble with `iocell` please open a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/bartekrutkowski/iocell/issues) and we will ~~run around with our hair on fire~~ look into it. Before doing so, please give us some information about the situation:
- Tell us what version of FreeBSD you are using with something like `uname -ro`
- It would also be helpful if you gave us the output of `iocell version`
- Most importantly, try to be detailed. Simply stating "I tried consoling into a jail and it broke" will not help us very much. However, saying something like this helps much, much more:


"I tried to console into a _template_ jail, but it failed with _this error_ in which _I pasted below:_"
````
gasgiant ~ # iocell list -t

**FEATURES:**
- Templates, clones, basejails, fully independent jails
- Ease of use
- Zero configuration files
- Rapid thin provisioning within seconds
- Automatic package installation
- Virtual networking stacks (vnet)
- Shared IP based jails (non vnet)
- Resource limits (CPU, MEMORY, etc.)
- Filesystem quotas and reservations
- Dedicated ZFS datasets inside jails
- Transparent ZFS snapshot management
- Binary updates
- Differential jail packaging
- Export and import
- And many more!

**QUICK HOWTO:**

`iocell(8)` requires a zfs pool to store its jails, templates and configuration.
FreeBSD's installer uses `zroot` as the default name for the system zpool, so
these examples below do too. If you wish, you may use an alternate zpool,
whether due to differing install-time choices, or if you have a dedicated zpool
for iocell to use instead.

`iocell activate zroot`

Fetch the latest *release* of FreeBSD from the public FTP site:

`iocell fetch`

Create a jail:

Make sure that the device name chosen below matches your main network interface,
as shown by `ifconfig(8)`, and that the IP address doesn't conflict with your
local network or DHCP address range.

`iocell create tag=myjail ip4_addr="em0|192.168.1.10/24"`

Start the jail:

`iocell start myjail`

Connect to the jail's console:

`iocell console myjail`

You now have root access within your jail -- enjoy!

**REQUIREMENTS**
- FreeBSD 11.2-RELEASE amd64 or newer
- ZFS file system
- Optional - Kernel compiled with:

        # This is optional and only needed if you need VNET and resource
        # limits

        options         VIMAGE # VNET/Vimage support
        options         RACCT  # Resource containers
        options         RCTL   # same as above

**OTHER CONSIDERATIONS**
- For resource limiting please read rctl(8)
- For the explanations on jail properties read jail(8)
- Create bridge0 and bridge1 interfaces

**HINTS**
- Use iocell set/get to modify properties
- To understand what most properties do read iocell(8).
- If using VNET consider adding the following to `/etc/sysctl.conf` on the host:

        net.inet.ip.forwarding=1       # Enable IP forwarding between interfaces
        net.link.bridge.pfil_onlyip=0  # Only pass IP packets when pfil is enabled
        net.link.bridge.pfil_bridge=0  # Packet filter on the bridge interface
        net.link.bridge.pfil_member=0  # Packet filter on the member interface
